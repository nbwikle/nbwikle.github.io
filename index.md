# About Me

Hello! I am an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Statistics and Actuarial Science](https://stat.uiowa.edu/) at the University of Iowa.

I received my Ph.D. in Statistics from Pennsylvania State University, where I was advised by [Ephraim Hanks](https://sites.psu.edu/hanks/). Following my Ph.D. I was a Postdoctoral Fellow in the [Department of Statistics and Data Science](https://stat.utexas.edu/people/postdoctoral-fellows) at the University of Texas at Austin, where I worked under the supervision of [Cory Zigler](https://sites.cns.utexas.edu/zigler/home). 

My research interests include spatial and spatio-temporal statistics, causal inference with interference, Bayesian hierarchical modeling, and statistical inference for dynamical systems. I am especially interested in applications of statistics to environmental health, environmental science, epidemiology, and ecology, where I'm motivated by problems that combine scientific knowledge with data-driven inference.
